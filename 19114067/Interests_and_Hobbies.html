My Hobbies are playing cricket, chess and badminton.I also watch cricket a lot, without missing any matches of my favourite teams. 
My favourite team is Indian cricket team(as expected), in International Cricket and Royal Challengers Bangalore(RCB), in IPL tournament. I started watching 
cricket when I was in 1st Standard,that is in 2007.I was very excited when India won the first T-20 world cup in 2007. Also, IPL started a year later, that is in
 2008, when I had completed my 1st Standard. From 1st Standard to 10th Standard, I enjoyed IPL during my summer vacations and watched it without missing any matches.
 But, I could not watch it the last 2 years because I was in hostel. But, cricket was always one of the most exciting things for me during childhood. But, I have not 
 taken any of these hobbies in sports to professional level. I just play it for fun and entertainment.</p>

 My other hobbies include reading scientific books in the field of Physics and Astronomy. My first book was 'The Theory of Everything' by Stephen Hawking, 
 when I was in 6th Standard. That book really boosted my interest in Physics and Astronomy and reading that book was a beautiful experience and I could never forget that.
 Later, I also read 'Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking, 'The Universe in my Hands' by Christophe Gallaphard, and I have recently started 'The Grand Design' by Stephen Hawking.
 I also like sky-watching and I have seen many constellations, planets and meteors. I also have a dream from my childhood to sit in a rocket and go to space. </p>
 <p>
 In Computer Science field, I am excited by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. I have not yet 
 studied these topics, or made any projects in these areas, since I am still learning basics in Computer Science, like Programming and Linux. But very soon, I will 
 be able to study these topics and then gain knowledge about them, so that I can then go deeper.
