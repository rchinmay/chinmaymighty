<h1> MEMORIES AND BLOGS</h1>
<p><h3>
I will write my intimate memories in reverse-chronological order(recent-ones first):<ul>
<li>One of my biggest recent achievements is qualifying JEE Advanced, and getting a rank of 345 AIR, which was first time
our school got a JEE Advanced rank below 2000 AIR, since our school did not focus much on this coaching and we were not even 
allowed to take external coaching.Due to this I got admitted in IIT Roorkee.</li>
<li> I qualified KVPY(Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana) in both 11th and 12th Standard.</li>
<li> I secured 2nd rank in K-CET(Karnataka- Common Entrance Test), which is very popular exam in Karnataka because all the 
engineering colleges in the state are given admissions only through that exam.</li>
<li> I got a 10 CGPA in my 10th Standard CBSE Board.</li>
<li> I participated in Regional-Level CBSE Science Exhibition held in Bangalore.</li>
<li> I was a finalist in Robotics Competition organised by IIT Bombay during Tech-Fest in December 2014, and the competition was conducted 
by Robokart-India.</li>
<li> I uploaded my first video on Youtube(Purely for fun) with my school friends, and later uploaded 3 more videos on 
Youtube. The links are:<a href="https://youtu.be/90XmreP9MzU/"><h2>My First Video</h2></a>

<p> <li><h3>This blog is about the Intro-talks and workshops of different groups in IIT Roorkee that I have attended and how I felt about them. My first month was filled with excitement
about the new life of mine in IIT-R and during this time many different groups in IIT-R also gave their Intro-talks and showed us the different oppurtunities available for us in 
this stay at IIT-R. The Intro-talks of the groups that I attended include: MDG, SDS Labs and their sister groups i.e, PAG, Info-Sec and Data Science Group,
IMG, MaRS, ACME, ArIES, PaAc, etc. I have also attended many of their workshops like the first workshop that I attended here was Web-Development workshop by SDS Labs, where they taught us to 
make our own webpage using HTML and CSS. It was very useful and informative workshop. The next workshop that i attended was a lecture on Computer Vision, by an alumini from IIT-R, which was organized by Data 
Science Group. It was also very useful to me as he introduced us to various fields in Computer Science and also explained about Computer Vision.
The next workshop that I attended was on Git-BASH and LINUX operating system, which was again organized by SDS Labs. It was the best workshop that I attended ammong all the workshops because it 
was the only workshop which was monitored and we would the majority of the work while learning by ourselves. The next workshop that I attended was by PaAC (Physics and Astronomy Club) and 
there a scientist explained us about Relativity and its Future predictions in physics, Though, it was video conference-based lecture, it was very informative and knowledgable. Later, in Raionzo fest, I 
attended the workshops for Web-Development, which was mainly focussed on Commercial Web-Development, and on the following day I attended the workshop for ML and AI, which was also very good and 
we learnt how to start with such interests and we also leant basics of Python Programming and Algorithms used in ML/AI. These workshops and Intro-Talks awere very useful to me and showed me some of the future oppurtunities
that I would be getting in this stay at IIT-R. So, I am looking forward to their future workshops and also try my best for their recruitments.</h3></li></p>
